## 📖 Overview

**Problem Statement 2: Web Development**

SitePilot is a robust, scalable multi-tenant SaaS platform that enables multiple non-technical users, independent organizations, and businesses to host and manage their own branded websites via a shared unified infrastructure. Taking inspiration from systems where independent teams operate under one governing structure, SitePilot provides a centralized platform that ensures high governance, operational consistency, and intelligent automation while allowing complete logical isolation among tenants. 

With SitePilot, building professional-quality websites is a breeze! AI-assisted creation automates layout generation, content structuring, and component formulation. All tenant operations—from onboarding, plan subscription, real-time collaboration, and monitoring—are streamlined.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🏢 Multi-Tenant Architecture and Isolation
Strict logical isolation keeps every tenant's data, assets, users, and branding strictly self-contained. The platform maintains a structured ecosystem wherein configurations and limits adjust according to exactly what the tenant's current subscription enables.

### 🤖 AI-Powered Website Builder
Leveraging state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence to massively cut down on manual labor:
- Automatically generate entire website layouts and structures using basic text prompts.
- Recommend UI components, hierarchical organizations, and accessibility configurations based on the business type.
- Empowers non-technical users to quickly deploy stunning, professional-grade websites effortlessly.

### 🏗️ Structured Site Creation & Content Workflow
Using an intuitive drag-and-drop workflow:
- Build modular pages utilizing a variety of customizable, reusable components.
- Keep the workflow organized with support for drafts, editing, and publishing stages.
- Automated safeguards strictly enforce responsive layouts and limits according to the tenant’s selected tier.

### 🎨 Branding and Asset Customization
Total control over tenant identities:
- Define global palettes, typography, logos, and media to apply consistently across entire site portfolios.
- Centralized media asset management with tier-specific storage allowances and automated accessibility checks.

### 🌐 Domain Management & Deployment Workflow
Launch to the world efficiently:
- Automatically generated default subdomains paired with support for **custom domain mapping**.
- Full deployment history logs updates, helping you roll back easily and move safely between preview drafts and production visibility.

### 🔐 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Robust security workflows that support collaboration mapping:
- Defines multiple hierarchical roles within organizations (Owner, Admin, Editor, Developer).
- Precise enforcement preventing unauthorized users from accessing billing details, sensitive content editing, or domain configurations.

### 💳 Subscription Plans & Automated Lifecycle Management
An integrated built-in economy engine:
- Flexible SaaS subscription tiers restricting websites, pages, AI prompts, custom domains, and components.
